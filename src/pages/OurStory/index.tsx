            Let me introduce myself. My name is Soeun, and I’ve been baking since I moved to Finland. I discovered sourdough baking about a year ago, and I’ve been hooked ever since. One of the main reasons I started baking was because of my autoimmune conditions, which make my body extra sensitive to chemicals, sugar, and other additives. I wanted to create healthy baked goods that both my body and I could enjoy—and now I’m thrilled to share them with you!
